# London-Chicago-Data-Science-Excercise

A data science exercise I did during my first semester at The University of London. More specifically, I made a complete data science pipeline in a single jupyter notebook to compare crime rates across the cities of London and Chicago. This included reading in the data, cleaning and restructuring the data, doing exploratory analysis, and drawing basic conclusions on crime trends in both cities. 


Due to the file size restrictions imposed by Github (100 megabytes), I am not able to host the full datasets, but cleaned_data contains a working sample of the full London and Chicago datasets, as well as a population workbook that contains population breakdowns for each city.


All in all, it was a lot of data-wrangling and data-cleaning work, but it was very satisfying to get it all working in the end.
