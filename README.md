# London-Chicago-Data-Science-Excercise

A data science exercise I did during my first semester at The University of London. More specifically, I made a complete data science pipeline in a single jupyter notebook to compare crime rates across the cities of London and Chicago. This included reading in the data, cleaning and restructuring the data, doing exploratory analysis, and drawing basic conclusions. 


Due to the file size restrictions imposed by Github, I am not able to host the full datasets, but XXX.
